### What I learned

Attempting this challenge I learned two things. The smallest of the two was finding out that button elements dont inherit fonts so it's nice to keep in mind that I need to watch out for certain elements that do not inherit values from parent elements. The main thing I learned from this challenge is being able to handle a layout that needs a max width for the content of the website, and then having other content expand past that width. Though I feel my attempt is not clean, it was great practice to do it this way and think about how I can plan out separating content better in order for stylings to be less tedious. The main issue was that I was manually adjusting near every element when I could have thought about how to group content more.

### Continued development

For layouts that have max widths and has content further along the web page being bigger than the content max width, I want to be able to find out ways to make it cleaner to work with rather than adjusting the pixels for each section to match the final outcome. 


### Useful resources

- [https://imagecolorpicker.com/en](https://www.example.com) - This helped me to get colors that was not provided from instructions. I was able to take a screenshot of the challenge and grab a color from it.
